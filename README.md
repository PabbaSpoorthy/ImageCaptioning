# ImageCaptioning
Let the image be described as we see it, by a trained model..!

Automatic Image Captioning System:
This project implements an automatic image captioning system using deep learning techniques. The system generates descriptive captions for images by employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for caption generation.

Technologies Used:
TensorFlow
PyTorch
OpenCV
